# Memory Card

[Live site](https://sheacronin.github.io/memory-card/).

A Degrassi-themed memory card game. Includes the options to play with 15-30 characters from *Degrassi Junior High* and the first two seasons of *Degrassi: The Next Generation*.

Click a character card each round: if you click a character you've previously selected, you lose the game; if you click on all characters without repeating any, you win the game.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
